## Code of Conduct

### Our Commitment
We are dedicated to creating an open and inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome to participate, regardless of age, body type, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. As contributors and maintainers, we pledge to ensure that everyone involved in our project and community can engage without fear of harassment or discrimination.

### Our Values
Examples of positive behavior that help foster a welcoming community include:

- Using friendly and inclusive language
- Respecting diverse perspectives and experiences
- Offering and receiving constructive feedback with grace
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community as a whole
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards fellow community members

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome sexual advances
- Trolling, insults, or derogatory comments aimed at individuals or groups
- Harassment, whether public or private
- Sharing someone’s private information, such as physical or electronic contact details, without explicit consent
- Any other actions that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are accountable for upholding these standards of behavior. They are expected to take appropriate and just actions in response to any instances of unacceptable conduct. This may include:

- Editing, removing, or rejecting comments, commits, code, wiki contributions, or any other form of interaction that fails to adhere to this Code of Conduct
- Temporarily or permanently banning any contributor for behavior deemed harmful, offensive, or inappropriate

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and extends to public forums where individuals are representing the project or community. Examples of representing a project include using the project’s official email, engaging on its social media platforms, or participating in an event as a designated representative. Project maintainers may clarify what constitutes representation as needed.

### Reporting and Enforcement
To report any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please contact the project team at ndeliwa@ncsu.edu/jrshah6@ncsu.edu/nhjasani@ncsu.edu. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly. Actions taken in response will be appropriate to the nature of the situation, and confidentiality will be maintained for the person reporting the incident.

Should project maintainers fail to adhere to or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith, they may face consequences, including temporary or permanent removal from the project’s leadership.
