### Pull Request Process
- Ensure that any install or build dependencies are cleaned up after the build process is completed.
- When making changes to the interface, update the `README.md` to reflect any new environment variables, exposed ports, important file paths, or container settings.
- Increment the version number in both the `README.md` and any relevant example files to reflect the changes introduced in your Pull Request. We adhere to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) guidelines.
- You can merge your Pull Request after receiving approval from two other developers. If you don’t have merge permissions, you can request one of the reviewers to merge it for you once it’s approved.
